# FetchRewards-TakeHome-Project-AE

# Project Overview

This project was completed as part of a take-home coding exercise for the **Analytics Engineer** role at **Fetch Rewards**. The goal was to analyze unstructured JSON data, design a structured relational data model, write SQL queries to address key business questions, and identify data quality issues.

## Project Structure

### Data Modeling
- **Structured Data Model**: 
  - Users
  - Brands
  - Receipts
  - Items
  
- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: 
  - Located in `ER_Diagram.jpg`

### SQL Implementation and Query Solutions
- **PostGreSQL Server**: 
  - Created and data inserted from preprocessed Excel files located in the `Data` folder.
  
- **Tables and Schema Creation Scripts**: 
  - `tablecreation.ipynb`

- **Data Insertion Scripts**:
  1. `users_insertion.ipynb`
  2. `brands_insertion.ipynb`
  3. `receipts_insertion.ipynb`
  4. `items_insertion.ipynb`

- **Business Query Solutions**: 
  - Located in `Query_Results` folder.
  - SQL code for all six questions along with a PDF containing screenshots of the query implementations.

### Data Quality Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis of all JSON files.
  - HTML export of findings located in the `Data_Quality_Analysis` folder.

### Communicate with Stakeholders
- A sample email to stakeholders is available in the `Email_stakeholders.pdf` file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze data, design relational models, write efficient SQL queries, and communicate effectively with stakeholders. I look forward to further opportunities to apply these skills in a professional setting.
